</div><p>While some may equate sonic booms to sounding like sharp cracks, the farther away you are from the jet, the more likely you might hear a rumbling sound that can shake buildings.</p><p>NASA aerospace engineer Edward Haering compared it to lightning strikes. The closer you are to the lightning, the more likely you’ll hear a sharp crack. The farther away you are, the more likely you’ll hear a rumble.</p><p>“It actually can shake the house. If you have a large building, the pressure hits the wall and vibrates it, and so the room will kind of vibrate a little bit,” said Haering, who works at the NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, Calif.</p><p>Sonic booms are produced when aircraft go faster than the speed of sound. They are like a 3-D version of the V-shaped waves that can be seen in the wake of a moving motor boat.</p><p>Instead of choppier water, the sonic boom vibrates the air, making a loud sound.</p><p>Haering said it can be hard for pilots to know where and how far sonic booms will travel. A lot depends on the weather and the direction of the wind, which helps determine where the sound will go.</p><p>“We’re working on efforts to make quiet supersonic aircraft that won’t disturb people,” Haering said.</p><p>It’s understandable that people might be spooked by hearing a sonic boom along the L.A. and Orange County coast, experts said. Sonic booms would be more expected over Edwards Air Force base, for instance.</p><p>“Sometimes, you see something out of context, and sometimes, it’s a little mysterious,” said Merlin, the aerospace historian.</p><p>Wednesday’s sonic boom as well as earlier similar incidents have caused some to speculate it could be the testing of the mythical top-secret Aurora spy plane project.</p><p>Merlin said Aurora is a fantasy, based on a misreading of a federal budget document in the 1990s as the government phased out the SR-71 Blackbird spy plane. Some thought Aurora was to be its replacement, but in fact, it was the codename of the well-known B-2 stealth bomber, which does not fly faster than the speed of sound, Merlin said.</p><p>The F/A-18 is a twin-engine fighter jet made by Boeing Co. that has been a fixture on U.S. Navy aircraft carriers since 1983. The plane is flown by the Blue Angels, the Navy’s flying aerobatic team.</p><p>The Super Hornet version of the aircraft became operational in 2001.</p><p>The aircraft’s fuselage sections are manufactured by Northrop Grumman Corp. in Los Angeles, in a 1-million-square-foot facility on Aviation Boulevard, about a mile south of Los Angeles International Airport.</p><p>It’s not uncommon for sonic booms to be mistaken for earthquakes. In February, residents along the Maryland coast were startled and reported floors shaking and doors rattling.</p><p>The boom coincided with a flight of supersonic jets, an F-35C and an F/A-18, flying from Patuxent Naval Air Station, the Baltimore Sun <a class="link" href="https://articles.baltimoresun.com/2014-02-07/travel/bal-earthquake-ocean-city-20140206_1_magnitude-ocean-city-earthquake" target="_blank">reported</a>. </p><p>Scott Conner, who lives in the Big Rock neighborhood of Malibu, said Wednesday he was convinced the shaking was a quake.</p><p>He said the shaking was so intense one of his computer monitors would’ve tipped over if he wasn’t there to steady it.</p><p>“I had to put out my hand to keep it from tipping over,” Conner said in a telephone interview.</p><p>“I thought it was the biggest quake I’ve ever been in…. This thing was big, big,” he said. “The whole house just lifted.”</p><p>Kit Fox, who works at Rancho Palos Verdes City Hall, said people walked out of their offices after being rattled.</p><p>“It was really just a short, sharp jolt, I think the shaking went on for about 3 to 5 seconds at most, but it definitely rattled people,” he said.</p><p>Fox said it felt more like the building shaking rather than the ground shaking.</p><p> </p></div></div>
